    "You can assume your input has only one channel. (a.k.a a normal 2D list/vector) And you do need to consider the padding method and size. There are 2 padding ways: REPLICA & ZERO. When \"REPLICA\" is given to you, the padded pixels are same with the border pixels. E.g is [1 2 3] is your image, the padded version will be  [[(...1 1) 1 2 3 (3 3...)]  where how many 1 & 3 in the parenthesis depends on your padding size. When \"ZERO\", the padded version will be [(...0 0) 1 2 3 (0 0...)]\n",

    "\n",
    "And now, we can describe it here:\n",
    "    We have 2 sets of points, say, Points A and Points B. We use A.1 to denote the first point in A, B.2 the 2nd point in B and so forth. Ideally, A.1 is corresponding to B.1, ... A.m corresponding B.m. However, it's obvious that the matching cannot be so perfect and the matching in our real world is like: \n",

    "    The target of RANSAC is to find out the true matching within this messy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Algorithm for this procedure can be described like this:\n",
    "    1. Choose 4 pair of points randomly in our matching points. Those four called \"inlier\" (中文： 内点) while others \"outlier\" (中文： 外点)\n",
    "    2. Get the homography of the inliers\n",
    "    3. Use this computed homography to test all the other outliers. And separated them by using a threshold into two parts:\n",
    "        a. new inliers which is satisfied our computed homography\n",
    "        b. new outliers which is not satisfied by our computed homography.\n",
    "    4. Get our all inliers (new inliers + old inliers) and goto step 2\n",
    "    5. As long as there's no changes or we have already repeated step 2-4 k, a number actually can be computed, times, we jump out of the recursion. The final homography matrix will be the one that we want.\n",
